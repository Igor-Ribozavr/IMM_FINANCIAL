            COVID-19: How Do We Re-open the Economy?

            With the IMF forecasting a 6.1% fall in advanced economy GDP in 2020
            and world trade expected to contract by 11%, there is intense focus
            on the question of how and when to re-open economies currently in
            lockdown. But no ‘opening up’ plan has a chance of succeeding unless
            it commands the confidence of all the main actors in the economy –
            employees, consumers, firms, investors and local authorities.
            Without public confidence, these groups may follow official guidance
            only sporadically; consumers will preserve cash rather than spend it
            on goods and services; employees will delay returning to work
            wherever possible; businesses will face worsening bottlenecks as
            some parts of the economy open up while key suppliers remain closed;
            and firms will continue to delay many discretionary investment and
            hiring decisions.

              Achieving public confidence
            </Typography>
            <br />
            Taken together, these behaviours would substantially reduce the
            chances of a strong economic bounce-back even in the absence of a
            widespread second wave of infections. Five key steps are needed to
            achieve a high degree of public confidence in any reopening plan.
            First, enough progress must be made in suppressing the virus and in
            building public health capacity so the public can be confident any
            new outbreak will be contained without reverting to another
            full-scale lockdown. Moreover, the general public needs to feel that
            the treatment capacity of the health system is at a level where the
            risk to life if someone does fall ill with the virus is at an
            acceptably low level. Achieving this requires the government to
            demonstrate the necessary capabilities - testing, contact tracing,
            quarantine facilities, supplies of face masks and other forms of PPE
            (personal protective equipment) - are actually in place and can be
            sustained, rather than relying on future commitments. It also needs
            to be clear on the role to be played going forward by handwashing
            and other personal hygiene measures.

            Our research this week explores how business operations may change
            as the travel industry and other sectors reimagine the next normal
            in a world of physical distancing and evolving consumer behaviors.
            For operationally intensive sectors, our analysis suggests that the
            COVID-19 crisis has accelerated automation and digitization.
            Upskilling and reskilling the workforce will become even more of a
            priority. For consumer-goods leaders, reshaping the sales function
            and fostering collaboration between retailers and manufacturers will
            be critical. More broadly, our conversations with executives this
            week demonstrate that successfully weathering the pandemic will also
            require a people-centered approach to internal and remote
            leadership. Our interview with Steve Collis, CEO of
            AmerisourceBergen, considers how a daily executive meeting can be
            used not only for decision making but also as an opportunity to
            extend empathy to colleagues. Mike Henry, CEO of BHP, similarly
            tells us that prioritizing people and building strong relationships
            has boosted the company’s resilience. He says, “Against the backdrop
            of COVID-19, there’s a premium on getting out, demonstrating
            empathy, and engaging with people to understand what their concerns
            are.” This week we also analyzed how companies can mitigate risks in
            industrial supply chains and utilize their procurement functions and
            spend analytics to bolster resilience; explored ways
            behavioral-health leaders can build on the current momentum for
            change in the industry; and looked at how Australia can gauge the
            scope of the pandemic’s effects on different industries and
            workforces and address cautious consumers. Also this week: we’ve
            added a special collection, The next normal: The recovery will be
            digital.

            COVID-19: Saving thousands of lives and trillions in livelihoods
          </Typography>
          <br />
          <br />
          <Typography align="justify">
            On March 23, 2020, McKinsey introduced the twin imperatives of
            safeguarding our lives and our livelihoods and a nine-scenario
            framework to describe potential economic and COVID-19 outcomes
            (Exhibit 1). At the time, we wrote that the best combined outcomes
            depended on a rapid and effective public-health response that
            controlled the spread of the novel coronavirus within two to three
            months. Similarly, in May, we wrote that crushing uncertainty by
            reducing the virus spread to near zero was likely the big “unlock”
            for most economies. Today, only a handful of countries seem to have
            placed the virus under control. (Economic-policy responses have been
            strong in many regions; most have been swift and effective enough to
            largely rule out the “first column” of scenarios.) Practically
            speaking, only countries that have already placed the virus under
            control can plausibly realize a “first-row outcome” (scenario A3 or
            A4) that lifts GDP to 2019’s year-end level or better by the end of
            2020. Absent a widely available COVID-19 vaccine, most other
            countries are likely facing a “second-row outcome” (scenario A1 or
            A2), which means a one- to two-year delay in economic recovery.
            Global executives seem to agree; as our July survey shows, their
            pessimism is growing. The arithmetic is straightforward. Countries
            are starting to report estimates of second-quarter GDP. Germany and
            the United States have registered 10.6 percent drops in the first
            half of 2020, while Spain and the United Kingdom have reported
            almost unimaginable declines of 22.7 and 22.1 percent, respectively.
            From this trough, growth would need to average 5 to 12 percent for
            two consecutive quarters to return GDP to the level at which it
            started the year. Our new research looking for visible indicators of
            economic activity that would suggest such a rebound in growth finds
            them only in the countries that have successfully placed the virus
            under control. The evidence heavily suggests that a multifaceted
            public-health response that goes well beyond a simple transient
            lockdown is a necessary first step to restore confidence and create
            the conditions for growth. It won’t be cheap: the cost of getting
            the virus under control is likely measured in the billions, or
            perhaps hundreds of billions, of dollars. But it is also clear that
            the opportunity cost of waiting is almost surely measured in unknown
            thousands of lives and trillions of dollars. The impact of delay is
            not linear. For every three months we delay in getting the virus
            under control, we push back the return of GDP to precrisis levels by
            about six months. Time is the enemy of both lives and
            livelihoods.The novel coronavirus and subsequent lockdowns have
            halted economic activity in nearly unprecedented ways: the only
            events that similarly brought local economic activity to a sudden
            stop are currency crises, such as the 1994 Mexican peso crisis and
            the 1997 Asian currency crisis. There are no global comparable
            precedents since World War II. The economic impact has been
            dramatic, and it seems reasonable to assume that lifting lockdowns
            would provide a proportional stimulus.

          <Typography align="justify">
            The scale of the economic challenge created by the COVID-19 pandemic
            has not been faced in the United States in nearly a century. The
            pandemic has not only exposed weaknesses in US health systems but
            also, just as quickly, exposed economic vulnerabilities. The impacts
            across employment and productivity are at levels not seen since the
            Great Depression. Sidebar About the authors To date, crisis-recovery
            planning has focused primarily on delivering the historically
            unprecedented levels of relief that are providing lifelines for
            individuals and businesses trying to remain solvent. It is also
            addressing the complex choreography required to reopen economies
            safely while minimizing resurgence of the virus—a challenge
            underscored by the recent rollback of or pause on reopen plans in
            many states. Now is the time, however, for governments to turn their
            attention to reimagining a stronger economic future by very
            deliberately addressing the vulnerabilities the crisis has exposed.
            National monetary, fiscal, and other policy decisions will provide
            large-scale boosts to aggregate supply and demand and will help
            create the conditions for renewed economic growth. Yet it is state
            and local leaders, together with their business and civic
            communities, who will shape the speed and inclusivity of the
            recovery. The COVID-19 crisis is forcing states and localities to
            balance a surge in demand for government expenditures with
            unprecedented funding shortfalls. At the same time, it is requiring
            them to find ways to build and fund strategies and programs to
            deliver stronger, more equal, and more resilient economies. The
            first step toward reimagining a more resilient economic future is to
            understand how and where the pandemic has most damaged the US
            economy at the state and local levels. Our analysis suggests that
            the COVID-19 crisis has had the worst impact in the following six
            areas: The sectors of the US economy that have suffered the most
            during recent recessions are also the ones experiencing the greatest
            economic impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. The most vulnerable have
            borne the brunt of the economic impacts. The pandemic has attacked
            the economically vulnerable, much like it has attacked those with
            preexisting health vulnerabilities. The economically vulnerable
            portion of the population is the least able to withstand this
            disruption: 86 percent of the US jobs that are vulnerable to pay
            cuts, lost hours, and layoffs are held by workers earning less than
            $40,000 a year. People of color and less-educated workers
            disproportionately work in those occupations. In contrast, only 1
            percent of jobs paying more than $70,000 and 13 percent of those
            paying between $40,000 and $70,000 a year are vulnerable to layoffs,
            furloughs, and reduced hours. Additionally, 40 percent of the
            revenues of Black-owned businesses are generated in the five most
            vulnerable sectors, compared with 25 percent of the revenues of all
            US businesses. McKinsey’s late-March 2020 Consumer Insights Survey
            found that, nationally, 52 percent of Black workers and 57 percent
            of Hispanic workers say the COVID-19 pandemic is a major threat to
            their personal financial situations, compared with 44 percent of
            white respondents. While those living from paycheck to paycheck have
            turned to unemployment assistance and food stamps, US billionaires’
            wealth increased by $584 billion, or 20 percent, between mid-March
            and mid-June. Many small businesses are on the brink of failure.
            Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), particularly young SMEs,
            are the lifeblood of employment growth. In the United States, 78
            percent of net employment growth between 2013 and 2018 was generated
            by companies less than five years old.1 The COVID-19 crisis has put
            particular strain on this segment. SMEs have fewer cash reserves to
            maintain employee salaries when shocks occur and have more trouble
            navigating and accessing channels of aid.

          <Typography align="justify">
            Fundamental to building a robust, reimagined postpandemic economy is
            keeping in mind the simultaneous and often self-reinforcing
            objectives of productivity improvement and inclusion. Nebraska,
            North Dakota, and Utah, for example, all had top-quintile GDP growth
            in the decade after the Great Recession, and all had top-quintile
            income equality as of 2018.8 MOST POPULAR INSIGHTS COVID-19:

            The quickening To deliver on the dual mandate of productivity growth
            and broad-based income growth, public leaders at the state,
            regional, and city levels may find it helpful to prioritize seven
            areas of focus as part of their recovery and reimagination plans.
            Together, those levers aim to increase aggregate supply through
            greater productivity and innovation while unlocking latent demand to
            deliver growth. There are three levers that address supply: Embrace
            and accelerate productivity enhancements. Many trends and
            disruptions may accelerate in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. Of
            them, automation and a shift of activities to online channels could
            be among the most relevant accelerating developments across many
            sectors. Some traditional sectors and occupations may be in decline,
            as a result, while newer ones may be generated. The economies that
            embrace and plan for those accelerating trends rather than resisting
            their impacts will most likely be the ones that outperform in the
            reimagined future. Public-sector leaders can incentivize the
            technology and skill investments needed for companies and workers to
            adapt to accelerated automation and digitalization. For example, the
            UK government, in collaboration with the manufacturing industry,
            launched a £20 million Made Smarter North West pilot to help SMEs
            navigate and adopt digital tools, including robotics and automation.
            Find new openings to build resilience through ‘health proofing’ and
            diversifying economies. Many sectors will be facing fundamental
            changes in how business is conducted in the postpandemic world, with
            a renewed emphasis on health. Hotels and airports are investing in
            contactless technology. New physical-distancing requirements will
            require numerous businesses to rethink. As such changes shake up
            businesses, policy makers and economic planners could take the
            opportunity to consider how to build back better, with healthy
            products and services. In addition, the current economic disruptions
            may also prompt policy makers to consider how to make their local
            economies more resilient through diversification of their economic
            activities. For example, New York City’s diversification away from
            finance toward tourism, business service, and the arts allows the
            city to withstand market volatility better. With its diversified
            base in education, research, and technology, Austin was able to add
            jobs during the Great Recession.9 Texas diversified by investing
            nearly $3 billion in cancer research and treatment in the first
            decade after the Great Recession, a move that helped boost its
            residents’ health outcomes and the state’s life-science ecosystem.
            Invest in innovation ecosystems. Building and strengthening
            innovation ecosystems—from state, business, and academia-led R&D to
            commercialization, start-up, entrepreneurship, and VC—will be
            critical in building a strong postpandemic economy and gaining
            global share of the innovation economy. Coordinated investments in
            R&D, talent, capital, place, and inclusion are all needed to
            strengthen regional innovation ecosystems. For example, the New York
            City metropolitan area anchored its innovation ecosystem in
            financial services and research universities, and that approach
            helped the area foster a robust tech sector and helped increase
            total VC investments more than five-fold from 2008 to 2017.
